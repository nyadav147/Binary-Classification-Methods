# Binary-Classification-Methods
Using NLP disaster with Kaggle dataset; applying all methods available for binary classification 

This notebook is based on a homework from Cornell Tech class - Applied Machine Learning. I used several machine learning techniques to perform classification on text data. Throughout the problem, i used the NLP with Disaster Tweets Kaggle competition, where the task is to predict whether or not a tweet is about a real disaster. 

Pre-processed the data using a) Bag of Words model and 2) n-gram model (N=2)

Methods used :
1) Naive Bayes classifier
2) Logistic regression
3) Linear and Non-Linear Support Vector Machine (change in kernel)

Found linear SVM working best with more intuition on what words decided the margins.
